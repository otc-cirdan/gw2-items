# gw2-items
A CSV containing information about all items in Guild Wars 2

# Description
The CSV in this directory contains some basic information about every item
accessible via the GW2 API, even those that aren't available in the in-game
trading post. This may be useful for importing into spreadsheets if, for
example, you have inventory information with Item IDs, but need to get the
corresponding names.

# Compatibility
New columns may be added to this at any time. You should always use the
headers to find the column you need. The only exception is that the first
column will always be ID, and the second column will always be Name.
